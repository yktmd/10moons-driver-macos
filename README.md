This is a simple driver with pyUSB code modified to handle the interaction events of the 10moons graphics tablet, that includes a passive two button pen.

## ❓ About

This repository is a driver that provides basic functionality for 10moons graphic tablets

> Tested on 10moons T503 (*product code:* `6970607220184`)

### ✨ Features

- X / Y positioning with limiting
- Pressure sensitivity and calibration (**no linearity correction yet**)
- Configurable touch thresholds
- Debug mode
- Configurable input actions:
  - Pen (stylus) buttons
  - Buttons on the tablet itself

## 🏗️ How to build and debug

### 1. Clone this repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yktmd/10moons-driver-macos.git
cd 10moons-driver-macos
```

### 2. Create python's virtual environment and install requirements

> **NOTE:** Tested on Python `3.13.12`

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Connect your tablet and wait a little while until it is detected by the system

### 4. Start driver

```shell
sudo venv/bin/python driver.py
```

### 5. Calibrating the pressure

1. Hover pen over tablet without touching it and write down `[RAW] Pressure: <-` value
2. Now, touch tablet as hard as you can and write down `[RAW] Pressure: <-` value again
3. Stop driver by pressing `CTRL` + `C`
4. Put these values into `pressure_in_min` and `pressure_in_max` inside config file
5. Start driver again in debug mode
6. Determine pressure at which you want touch / release to be registered using value from `[OUT] X: ..., Y: ..., pressure: <-`
7. Stop driver by pressing `CTRL` + `C`
8. Edit `pressure_threshold_press` and `pressure_threshold_release` in config file if needed

> **NOTE:** You can provide path to config file with `-c [CONFIG]` argument
>
> **NOTE:** You can enable debug mode in config file itself
>
> **NOTE:** In case of errors after restarting driver, try reconnecting the tablet or restarting your computer
  
### 💻 In case of multiple monitors connected

> Not tested
  
#### 1. run `xrandr` to identify the name of the Display that you want to limit your tablet x & y coords

*e.g.:*

```text
DisplayPort-1
```

#### 2. run `xinput` to list all virtual devices,  identify the virtual core pointer associated with tablet pen

*e.g.:*

```text
↳ 10moons-pen Pen (0)                      id=17 [slave  pointer  (2)]
```

#### 3. configure xinput to restrict x&y coords to relevant monitor

*e.g.:*

```shell
xinput map-to-output 17 DisplayPort-1
```

## ⚙️ Configuring tablet

Configuration of the driver placed in `config-vin1060plus.yml` file

You can provide path to it using `-c` argument

> **Pls read config file with it's comments for more info**

## 🔳 Changing Button/Key shortcuts

`config-vin1060plus.yml` contains a Key code list (`tablet_buttons` variable) that allows the user to edit the 12 buttons found on the left-side of the graphics tablet.

To list all the possible key codes you may run:

```shell
python -c "from evdev import ecodes; print([x for x in dir(ecodes) if 'KEY' in x])"
```

`config-vin1060plus.yml` also contains a BTN code list (`pen_buttons` variable) that allows the user to edit the 2 buttons found on passive stylus pen.

To list all the possible Mouse/Stylus BTN codes you may run:

```shell
python -c "from evdev import ecodes; print([x for x in dir(ecodes) if 'BTN' in x])"
```

> Useful Doc explaining how the Kernel categorises and uses those ecodes:

>
> Input-Event-codes Src from Github:
  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h>

You can also use multiple keys at the same time separated with `+`

For example, to bind `CTRL` + `Z` on `CTRL` button (bottom left):

```yaml
actions:
    ...
    tablet_buttons:
        ...
        # Labelled as 'CTRL'
        63283: KEY_LEFTCTRL+KEY_Z
```

## 📜 The progress so far

### History of development

- Started as 10moons-driver by [Alex-S-V](https://github.com/alex-s-v/10moons-driver)
- Forked by [f-caro](https://github.com/f-caro/10moons-driver-vin1060plus) and modified for `vin1060plus`
- Refactored by [Fern Lane](https://github.com/F33RNI)
- Forked by [yktmd](https://github.com/yktmd) and modified for MacOS and refactored.

Thanks to [Digimend - https://github.com/DIGImend](https://github.com/DIGImend) for providing valuable functionality not just to 10moons Tablets, but to a variety of other popular Tablets.

Unfortuantely, Mr Digimend has chosen not to further develop the driver applicable to VINSA 1060plus, due to the inaccurate information transmitted between the T501 chipset and the USB driver --> [Live recording of Mr DIGIMEND working on 10moons tablet debug and analysis.  Awesome to see the master at work :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmnSwjlpRBE).

So an alternative workaround was needed.  In steps Alex-S-V with his pyUSB implementation of the T503 driver --- together with the [Digimend 10moons-Probe tool](https://github.com/DIGImend/10moons-tools),  it has the particular effect of switching the Graphics Tablet out of AndroidActiveArea Mode and into FullTabletArea mode. I will need to ask the original author (Mr.Digimend) how he identified the hex string to transmit to the tablet [ (probe.c src: line#165 ---> SET_REPORT(0x0308, 0x08, 0x04, 0x1d, 0x01, 0xff, 0xff, 0x06, 0x2e); ) ] (<https://github.com/DIGImend/10moons-tools/blob/6cc7c40c50cb58fefe4e732f6a94fac75c9e4859/10moons-probe.c#L165>)

The person to discover this "hack" was Mr.Digimend himself and thanks to the [Youtube video that he uploaded time-stamp @1:40.11](https://youtu.be/WmnSwjlpRBE?t=6011) he shows that usbhid-dump  output when in Android-Active-Area Mode (8 byte TX)  vs  the required  Full-Tablet-Active-Area mode (64 byte TX).

In the last fork of repo, Fern Lane has refactored the code. She fixed the pressure calculation, moved most of the parameters to a configuration file, making it more universal (with the ability to use it on other similar models), added logs and cli args, made the usage more intuitive, and removed the need for `10moons-tools`.

## 📑 TODOS

- Make a GUI and use it for calibration and mapping the buttons.

- Map the 10 "virtual buttons" found on the top-side of the graphics tablet active area: (`mute`, `vol_dwn`, `vol_up`, `music_player`, `play_pause`, `prev_song`, `next_song`, `home_btn`, `calc_btn`, `desktop_view`)

- Allow the Graphics App (e.g. Gimp, Scribus, Pix, Inkscape etc. ) to make use of the "pressure sensitivity" measurement

- Use its linear Z-axis "pressure sensitivity" measurements and map it to a non-linear function (maybe bezzier-curve) that simulates more natural pen strokes
